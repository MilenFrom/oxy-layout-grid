# oxy-layout-grid
Simple grid layout for Oxygen Builder. Similar as you can find in Adobe XD.

- Ui is not that great, I will take a look on it later on.


- Would be cool if the user could choose gap width and color from color picker
  
- Don't know if there is a simple possibility to fetch max-width from user settings panel so the user has to choose just 100% or max-with.

- Regardless on that, I have to set input field to fetch and use just number instead of number+px.
    
- Later on it could be transformed also in CSS Grid, but I will have to take a deep dive inside.
